# Virtual_Arts_Technical
A 2 day technical test conducted for the first stage of recruitment for Virtual Arts.
My breif was to create a piece of software using either Unity or Unreal Engine that can place primitive shapes in the world and perform various edits on them such as change color, rotate or scale. I was given 48 hours to complete this.

I had to make an accompanying demo video of the software which is linked here
